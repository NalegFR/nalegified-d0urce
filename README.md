# d0urce, but modified
I just wondered how I could code in some features I wanted in prettier or prettier d0urce.
So, I learnt javascript for like 2 days and brought this to life.
This can be really unstable because I'm not a pro javascript programmer at all  
**This is made on the (now official) version 1.6.4 of d0urce**
## New features
- ~~Customizable image background~~ Was added to Xen0o2's prettier
- That's it
- For now at least
- I swear I will code in more things

# How to ...
### ...install on TemperMonkey ?
1. Copy the raw link of the script : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalegFR/nalegified-d0urce/main/nalegified-d0urce.js`
2. Go to your TemperMonkey's utilities
3. Paste the link in "Import from URL", then click Install
Normally TemperMonkey installs the script automatically when going to the script and clicking "Raw", but for some reason it doesn't want to here

### ...edit my background image ?
Two ways :
1. Go to your settings and scroll down to "Edit background image"
2. Right click on s0urce desktop and click "Edit background"

# Known issues
There are no issues because we are all perfect developers

# TODO
- Display BTC amount on profile instead of username (currently it's disabled because it breaks a ton of things)
- Colors for background
- NPC Editor (change locally NPC's name, descriptions, and PFPs) (how am I gonna do that)
- More things when I'll get the idea
