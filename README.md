# d0urce, but modified
I just wondered how I could code in some features I wanted in prettier or prettier d0urce.
So, I learnt javascript for like 2 days and brought this to life.
This can be really unstable because I'm not a pro javascript programmer at all
**This is currently made on version 1.5.1 of prettier d0urce**
## New features
- Customizable image background
- Fixed logs when counterhacking (kinda)
- That's it
- For now at least
- I swear I will code in more things

# How to ...
### ...install on TemperMonkey ?
1. Copy the raw link of the script : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NalegFR/nalegified-d0urce/main/nalegified-d0urce.js`
2. Go to your TemperMonkey's utilities
3. Paste the link in "Import from URL", then click Install

### ...edit my background image ?
(it's been broken by the new update apparently :( )
Go to s0urce settings, then scroll down to "Edit background image".  
You can upload your own image or import it from a URL (press enter when putting a URL).  
The background image will save inbetween sessions.

# Known issues
### Background settings doesn't appear
This is due to how d0urce works. Try opening the log, then wait until it shows "Running Prettier d0urceOS".

# TODO
- Colors for background
- ~~Fix counterhacking's log modification working like once out of 16587867468 times~~
- Definitely fix counterhacking
- NPC Editor (change locally NPC's name, descriptions, and PFPs) (how am I gonna do that)
- More things when I'll get the idea
