# d0urce, but modified
I just wondered how I could code in some features I wanted in prettier or prettier d0urce.
So, I learnt javascript for like 2 days and brought this to life.
This can be really unstable because I'm not a pro javascript programmer at all
## New features
- Customizable image background
- That's it
- For now at least
- I swear I will code in more things

## TODO
- Colors for background
- Fix counterhacking's log modification working like once out of 16587867468 times
- More things when I'll get the idea

**This is currently made on version 1.4 of prettier d0urce**
